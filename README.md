## Use case
To determine the most important features and samples simultanously using Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm as described in [SUFFUSE: Simultaneous Fuzzy-Rough Feature-Sample Selection](http://www.jait.us/index.php?m=content&c=index&a=show&catid=168&id=889) By Javad Rahimipour Anaraki, Saeed Samet, Jeon-Hyun Lee and Chang Wook Ahn

## Compile
This code can be run using [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) R2006a and above

## Run
To run the program open `main.m` in MATLAB, choose any dataset (by considering the requirements stated in **Note** section), and hit F5. 

All datasets are stored in *data* folder and originally adopted from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

## Note
Datasets end with *OK.csv* in their names should have no column and/or row names, and the class values should be numeric and sorted in ascending order. The ones ending with *W.csv* should have columns name and the class values should be alphabetical.
